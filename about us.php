                <p>In 1960, Creative Jewellers opened its doors to the world. The first Creative Jewellers showroom
                    was
                    opened at Battaramulla, Colombo by Mr. Kaveen Udesh who was a visionary and
                    undoubtedly, ahead of his time.</p>

                <p>The name Creative was given to this jewellery boutique to signify the exquisite pieces of
                    jewellery
                    it has always been reputed for. Fashion forward, vibrant, beautiful and authentic in design and
                    materials; Creative Jewellers is a name that embodies a rich history of always giving its
                    customers
                    the widest range of jewellery.</p><br />

        <p>It is a fact that most customers prefer to buy high-end items from brick-and-mortar stores, which
            are
            perceived as more reliable and provide the opportunity to touch and feel the merchandise. This
            is a
            crucial factor in a high-involvement category such as jewellery driven by sensory experience.
            Our
            spacious showroom is designed with the idea of a unique shopping experience, showcasing the
            spellbinding
            beauty and breathe of the Creative product range.</p>
        <p>The studio is decked out in state of the art technology and all equipment and space required that
            allows
            for the artisans and craftsmen to give of their best, and create masterpieces of jewellery.</p>
        <p>From a small cluster of 5 loyal employees we have risen and expanded to a stellar staff of 400
            persons a
            testament to our resilience in a highly competitive industry and our ambition and drive to be a
            strong
            national brand in Sri Lanka.</p>
